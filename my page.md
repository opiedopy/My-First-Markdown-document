# My First Biology Markdown Note

Hello! This is a simple example file written in **Markdown**.  
It looks plain in a text editor, but becomes nicely formatted when previewed.

## Why I Like Biology
- Cells are amazing little factories
- Photosynthesis turns sunlight into food
- DNA carries the instructions for life

### Quick Facts About Cells

| Part of Cell     | What it Does                          | Fun Analogy          |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Nucleus          | Holds DNA, the "brain" of the cell    | Control center       |
| Mitochondria     | Makes energy (ATP)                    | Power plant          |
| Cell Membrane    | Controls what goes in and out         | Security gate        |

#### A Simple Diagram Idea
# (Imagine a hand-drawn picture here later)

My favorite biology topic right now: **Photosynthesis**  
Equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Questions I still have:
1. How do mitochondria "talk" to the nucleus?
2. Why do some cells have chloroplasts and others don't?

**To-do for next study session:**
- Draw my own cell diagram
- Watch a video on cellular respiration
