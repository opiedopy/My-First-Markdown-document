### What is Jupyter (Notebook)?

****Jupyter Notebook**** (or the newer ****JupyterLab****) is an
interactive web-based environment (runs in your browser) for creating
****computational documents****—files that combine:

-   Executable code (Python, R, Julia, MATLAB via kernel, etc.)
-   The output/results from running that code (graphs, tables, printed
    numbers)
-   Explanatory text written in ****Markdown**** cells

A single .ipynb file (Jupyter's format) is like a live, executable
report: write explanations in Markdown, add code cells to analyze data,
run them to see results inline, then add more text interpreting what you
saw.

****Key differences from plain Markdown****:

-   Markdown is static text formatting only.
-   Jupyter is dynamic: code runs live, outputs appear right there
    (e.g., plot a graph from data, change a variable and re-run to see
    updated results).
-   It's built for exploratory work: data analysis, simulations, machine
    learning experiments—very common in bioinformatics, computational
    biology, stats-heavy bio courses.

****Biology-student examples****:

-   In a genomics class: Load DNA sequence data → run Python code to
    count genes or plot expression levels → Markdown cell explains "This
    heatmap shows upregulation in cancer samples" with the plot right
    below.
-   Pre-med physiology: Simulate drug concentration over time with
    equations → show graphs of blood levels → add Markdown notes on
    half-life implications.
-   Lab data analysis: Import CSV from experiment → use pandas/numpy to
    calculate means/std dev → display table + bar chart inline →
    Markdown discussion of results.

Many Clemson biology/bioinformatics/research courses use Jupyter because
it's perfect for "showing your work" reproducibly—code + results +
explanations all in one shareable file.

****How they connect****:

-   Jupyter Notebooks use ****Markdown**** for all the non-code cells
    (text, headings, lists, images, equations).
-   So when we said "edit notes in VS Code" or "upload to GitHub," it's
    often Markdown files (.md) for simple docs, but Jupyter (.ipynb) for
    interactive analysis.
-   GitHub renders both nicely: .md files look like formatted pages;
    .ipynb files show as interactive notebooks (with code/output cells
    visible).

**Bottom line for your granddaughter**:

-   Start with **Markdown** in VS Code/GitHub—it's the easiest entry
    (just text formatting for notes/lab reports).
-   If/when she hits data-heavy biology classes (stats, bioinformatics,
    research), **Jupyter** will feel like a natural next step—especially
    since it's free (via Anaconda installer) and pairs perfectly with
    Python (common in bio now).
